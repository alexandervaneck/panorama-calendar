# Panorama Calendar for Obsidian

Panorama Calendar allows you to view your .ical calendars in a yearly (linear) view.
It makes it easier to think of a full year of events in either month-by-month, linear or cyclical way.

## Workflow suggestion

To avoid duplication Panorama Calendar is read-only and uses your .ical calendars as a source of truth.
It works by reading from multiple calendars .ical links which can be found in your calendar application.
For Google Calendar you can find the .ical link in the settings of your calendar under "Integrate calendar" and "Secret address in iCal format".

I suggest that you create multiple calendars in your primary calendar application for each area of planning you want to track.
These will show up as different colors when added to Panorama Calendar.

## Usage

1. Install the plugin.
2. Add your .ical calendars to the plugin settings.
3. Adjust the default calendar view.
4. Open the calendar from the sidebar.
